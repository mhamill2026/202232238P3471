<div class="newspaper">
This is a;; very fun and I will continue to type along with anything I think of. Actually I feel quite unwell at the moment and I just want to go home. I'm definetly gonna fall asleep in this next class and I will not have a good time. I chose to be class rep before Aiden so now's not a good time to have volunteered
